<h3>Web application build with Java and Spring Boot</h3>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/JyGLFYq/index.jpg">


<h2> About the project </h2>
<ul>
<li>The idea behind this project is for residential entities management platform. 
A platform that allows the registration of both home owners and residential entity managers. The platform provides an opportunity to receive messages (notifications) for various events, different user roles, validation of data and user registration verification by a moderator/manager, data on amounts due, monthly taxes, statements, news and etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Some of the features </h2>
<ul>
  <li>User can register as Resident or Manager</li>
  <li>As a first step the manager have to register in the platform and register a Residential entity</li>
  <li>When the entity is registered an 8-digit residential entity code (ID) is generated. Together, with an access code
  created by the manager, an user (resident) can register in the platform. The resident cannot register withour at least one active residential entity</li>
  <li>After the registration, the resident can register his apartment (property) in the existing residential entity. Every request for registration has to be approved by the manager</li>
  <li>The manager has the option to reject registration or accept it. If the request is rejected, the resident can edit it and resend it agan.</li>
  <li>If the manager approve the request, the resident is now free to see available data for his property. The manager can perform changes to properties and taxes whenever he needs to.</li>
  <li>There are integrated some automatic messages (notifications) for some events, and on next stage there will be also an option for messages from person to person.</li>
  <li>There are no limits of apartments (properties) that one user can have, even in different residential entities. 
  There is also a possibility, one manager to manage different residential entities.</li>
  <li>Manager can change residential entity data whenever he needs. Also, can delete an residential entity if there are no registered residents in it.</li>
  <li>Messages (notifications) can be archived or deleted.</li>
  <li>Only Residential entity manager can edit a part of property data as number of adults living in apartment, number of children, number of pets, property number and property floor. Also the amount of monthly taxes</li>
  <li>Only owner can view and edin personal property data.</li>
  <li>Manager and Moderator receive emails for every new property registration request</li>
  <li>Moderator can see all registered users, and have limited access to available modifications and actions</li>
  <li>User-to-user messages</li>
  <li>Sending email via contact form</li>
  <li>Reset forgotten password functionality</li>
  <li>On next stage admin will be able to update and delete all managers in the platform via user interface and a news feed will be created.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Security</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Due to the nature of the platform, security settings require additional than standard security checks. The variety of options for property registrations in different       Residential entities requires multiple additional checks to ensure that a user or moderator cannot manipulate someone else's data.</li>
  <li> Not logged in users have access to login page, register page and contact page.</li>
  <li> Users with Moderator role can access Messages and Administration sections</li>
  <li> USers with Resident role can access Messages and Property section</li>
  <li> A moderator is able to manage his own residential entities. All Get and PostRequests are prohibited in case of another user with moderator rights tries to execute a request.</li>
  <li>User with role Resident is able to manage his own properties. All Get and PostRequests are prohibited in case of another resident tries to execute a request for another user property.</li>
  <li>User with role Resident is able to manage his own messages (notifications). All Get and PostRequests are prohibited in case of another resident tries to execute a request for another user messages (notifications).</li>
</ul>

<h2> How to start the app</h2>
